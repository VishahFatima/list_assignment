# Introduction
This repository contains solutions to the "List Operations Assignment" completed as part of the Post Graduate Diploma in Data Science & AI at NED University of Engineering & Technology. The assignment covers various topics related to Python lists, including basic operations, slicing, indexing, list comprehension, manipulation, advanced slicing, and nested lists.

## Assignment Topics
1. **Basic List Operations**: Demonstrates fundamental list operations such as append, extend, insert, remove, pop, and more.
2. **Slicing and Indexing**: Illustrates slicing and indexing operations to access elements within a list.
3. **List Comprehension**: Provides examples of using list comprehension to create new lists from existing ones.
4. **List Manipulation**: Covers methods for sorting, reversing, and copying lists, as well as removing duplicates.
5. **Advanced Slicing**: Explores advanced slicing techniques, including step values and negative indices.
6. **Nested Lists**: Shows how to work with lists of lists, also known as nested lists, and perform operations on them.

## Usage
Each topic is implemented as a separate Python script or Jupyter Notebook, with clear explanations and examples. You can clone this repository and explore the solutions to gain a better understanding of list operations in Python.
